The contrcts for this version of the project are not practical, because the Nova proofs are not directly verifiable on Solidity. 
The `main.sol` simply provides the top level implementation of the system discussed in the C2PA-Marketplace Appendix of the paper, but it has no proper functionality yet and is provided as is.

However, we have already been working to migrate to Sonobe library that provide a fully functional Solidity verifier for the Nova proofs.
