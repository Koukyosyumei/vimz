# __zKrono__: Zero-Knowledge proofs of Chronicles
<img width="100%" src="samples/2K.png" alt="Generated by AI ()">

zKrono is currently (Dec. 2023) the fastest and most efficient program to proof authenticity of transformed/editted images w.r.t. an original source based on [Nova](https://github.com/microsoft/Nova) and especifically [Nova-Scotia](https://github.com/nalinbhardwaj/Nova-Scotia) (using [Circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) language for internal circuits).
The protocol supports image resolutions of up to 4K (3840 x 2160).
