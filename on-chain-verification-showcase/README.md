# Proof of Provenance: On-Chain Verification

## Summary

This is a demonstration of how the **VIMz** tool can be used to generate ZK proofs for image manipulation, which can then be verified **on-chain**, thanks to integration with the **Sonobe** library.

The showcase scenario involves two main actors:
- **Challenger**: Creates a challenge by publishing an image to IPFS and specifying a required transformation.
- **Solver**: Processes the image, applies the transformation, and generates a ZK proof of correctness using the VIMz tool.

A smart contract on an **EVM-based blockchain** governs the challenge. The solver submits their solution along with a ZK proof, and if the proof is valid, they receive a reward. The contract verifies the proof **on-chain** before approving the submission.

## Technical Details

### Contracts

#### Challenge Hub

The main contract is [`ChallengeHub.sol`](ChallengeHub.sol).
It acts as a registry for all challenges as described below.

- A challenge creator can call `createChallenge`, providing:
    - Source image ID (e.g., an IPFS identifier).
    - Proposed reward.
    - Required transformation.

- Once a challenge is published, solvers can submit their solutions by calling `submitSolution` with:
    - Challenge ID.
    - Solution image ID.
    - ZK proof of the transformation's validity.

The proof is verified **on-chain** using a **verifier contract** (see below).
The first solver to submit a valid solution receives the reward.

#### Verifier Contracts

Each transformation type has a **dedicated verifier contract**, generated by the **Sonobe** library.
Source codes are available in the [`verifier-contracts`](verifier-contracts/) directory.

### Image Registry

Since images are too large to be passed via calldata or stored on-chain, an off-chain storage solution is required.
This can be IPFS, Swarm, or any decentralized storage.

For this demo, a local IPFS node is used to store images.

### Off-Chain Tools

The off-chain components include:
- An image editor (a simple Python script).
- VIMz tool, used to generate ZK proofs, which are compatible with Sonobe verifiers.

All transformations are implemented as **Circom circuits**, located in the [`circuits`](../circuits/sonobe) directory.

## Running the scenario locally

### Requirements

1. You must be able to run VIMz tool together with its dependencies (like `Rust`, `Python3`, `Circom`, `Node`).
2. Foundry (https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).
3. IPFS (https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/).
4. Auxiliary tools like `jq`, `xxd`, `cut`.

You can check if you have all the necessary tools by running the following command:

```bash
./check-env.sh
```

In case you are missing some tools, the script will print out the instructions on how to install them.

### Launching the scenario

You can launch scenario by running `./scenario.sh`.
It will perform the following steps:
1. Check if all the required tools are available.
2. Install node dependencies (used in contract deployment).
3. Start a local Anvil node.
4. Build and deploy the contracts.
5. Create a challenge (upload an image to IPFS and create a challenge in the contract).
6. Solve the challenge (download the image, apply the transformation, generate a proof, and submit it to the contract).
7. Verify the solution on-chain and pay the reward.
8. Stop the Anvil node.
